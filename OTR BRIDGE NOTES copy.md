# Main How To
## Pre Bridge Prep
- check routes and mark anything that still needs to be marked
	- basically get cortex as close to 0 as possible
	- in station/ on road scrub
		- in station and on road scrub can go back to back but you need to wait 10 minutes between on road and review missing/lost
		- dont forget to review missing and lost packages
- [OTR PERFECT MILE](https://perfectmile-na.amazon.com/dashboards/woodwajo/region/NA/daily?tab=55679&start-date=2023-08-06&end-date=2023-08-12&drilldowns=location/cycle_name/dsp&filter-in-location=%5BDBO6%5D)
## PNOV Bridge
- copy table from PNOV war room
- go to pnov tracker (anything under 250 is good but bridge to 0)
	- paste into [PNOV Tracker](https://share.amazon.com/sites/dbo6/_layouts/15/WopiFrame2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7Bd70fc45f-50c2-4649-bbf2-518ce6d5a6f3%7D&action=edit&wdInitialSession=c2db8ba0-519e-a0bf-d2b7-352f7085d808&wdRldC=1)
		- when you add the heading for today highlight the blue and add filter using the top bar
- add data filter table and sort by status(column 3rd from the right)
- go to perfect mile and start bridge(parcel NOV DPMO)
	- threshold for bridge is 0
	- title: parcel NOV DPMO
	- root causecategory: marked missing unable to deliver
		- root cause: 0
	- Details: parcel nov dpmo at number against goal of 0, number packages go against number dispatched
		- copy TBA, DA, and DSP columns
			- have a category for lost
			- have a category for RTS (note if returned by same DA)
	- get DMPO from pnov dpmo calculator
	- actions: make something business up 
		- you could callout the RTS items to the respective DSPs
		- theres not much you can do with lost packages
## RTS Bridge (bridge version)
- plug into DPMO Calculator
- check ootd DPMO
- PERFECT MILE BRIDGE
	- threshold is 5k dpmo
	- grab config RTS file
	- grab rts email
		- refresh and double click on returns blank
		- sort by z to a and see who returned alot of ootd
			- basically your looking for things that were returned incorrectly
				- late delivery, returned as delivered, damaged, rejected, anything scrubbed are all blanks
			- this will also show all the scrub missings at the bottom of the page
	- root causes: return to station at number against goal of 5000, rts number packages make up the miss against sort volume dispatched
	- copy paste the return orange section to itemize returns
		- only do the top offenders
	- notable blanks
		- paste the biggest offenders, such as scrub missing from flex
		- note that they were scrubbed
	- remember to look at previous day as a template
	- end bridge by comparing DPMO with vs without the mentioned returns
	- for details just copy paste all returns section on rts email file
## RTS Bridge(email only)
- make sure Outlook is open
- make sure Config OTR file is open
- make sure rts email excel is up to date and hit Email Button
- verify info looks right then send
## OOTD DPMO Bridge
- basically rts bridge again
- threshold for bridge is 1000 dpmo
## PFSD Bridge
- sameday DEA bridge
	- Bridging for Previous day not today
	- look for Same Day DEA controllable miss in perfect mile
	- basically just note missed dispatch packages
	- bridge to 0
	- grab data from cell directly below for data on which packages missed
	- get more details from Aaron on wed
## Bilinski Wash.
- note: dont send with links present
- first page
	- DSP OTD -> grab from link to the right
	- Flex OTD -> mostly a guesstimate
	- rts DPMO -> grab from rts dpmo bridge
	- ootd dpmo -> grab from ootd dpmo bridge
	- pnov dpmo -> grab from pnov dpmo bridge
	- RTS Number -> grab from Mercury
	- undispatched -> rolled volume or flex routes that didnt go out
	- problem solve audit section -> mark yes or no if it was done
	- liquid damage sim -> need to figure out
	- fixit que snip -> link in the paste region
		- grab issue type and to be fixed column
- second page
	- each section has a link to the relevant results
	- RTS Reason codes -> grab from rts bridge excel file
	- RTS Reason codes SCC Status -> grab raw data from rts bridge excel file
		- grab tbas
		- search in SCC
		- download results 
		- pivot as table
			- tracking id in values
			- state in rows
			- sort from largest to smallest
	- RTS by DSP
		- copy each dsp total from green section in rts bridge excel file
	- ootd by DSP
		- go into returns by blank
			- filter by out of delivery time
			- sort by DSP
	- business closed by DSP
		- fo into returns by business closed
		- same as returns by blank
	- business closed by routes
		- look at business closed and grab top offending drivers to find top offending routes
	- high rts routes
		- grab top rts route
	- missing still missing
		- from pnov bridge
		- grab from cortex under dive deep for rts/pnov
	- RTS same DA
		- from pnov bridge
		- grab from cortex under dive deep for rts/pnov
	- rts different DA
		- from pnov bridge
		- grab from cortex under dive deep for rts/pnov
- send to 
	- get emails from greg
	- copy page one into email
	- copy page two into email
	- copy repack tracker into email
	- send/
# Optimization ideas
- [x] add dpmo calculator somewhere in final tool
- [ ] create script to pull data from rts email 
- [ ] create script to auto generate email similar to rts email tool
- [ ]
